{"name":"nun-radio","tagline":"Wii Nunchuck based RC radio","body":"### Welcome to nun-radio.\r\n\r\nNun-radio is a Wii Nuncuck based RC transmitter. Something that let's you control 4 channels with a single hand. A full-featured, single-stick ergonomic radio, that's especially handy for multi-hour sessions soaring on the slopes. \r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n* Reading from nunchucks\r\n* Sending data to Frsky's DIY radio module (or any ppm radio)\r\n* Reading telemetry from FrSky's DIY radio module (2-way protocol)\r\n* Remaining battery/rssi display\r\n* Audible alarm for low battery and low signal strength\r\n* Expo and dual rates\r\n* A screen display with model and setup information\r\n* Multiple models with selection\r\n* Persistent trim\r\n* Switching between mode1/mode2 (elevator/aileron via tilt or via joystick)\r\n\r\n### Controls\r\n\r\nThe only control input is the Wii Nunchuck. I've tested with wireless and wired models, the original nintendo one as well as cheap knockoffs. The all seem to work just fine.\r\n\r\nBy default tilt left/right controls roll. Tilt forward/backwards controls pitch. Joystick left/right is for rudder, up/down is for throttle.\r\n\r\n#### Mode 1/Mode 2 toggle\r\n\r\nYou can also flip what joystick and tilt controls. That's achieved by hitting the Z button.\r\n\r\n#### Calibration\r\n\r\nCalibration can be entered by moving the joystick full right and hitting both C and Z buttons at the same time. The screen will show instructions on how to perform the calibration.\r\n\r\n#### Trim\r\n\r\nTrim can be set by holding a certain position on the joystick and with tilt and hitting the C button. The current position will immediately become the new center. Trim can be performed any number of time, each time the \"new\" center will be relative to the \"current\" center. This way you can trim each axis one by one.\r\n\r\nSaving the current trim is done by holding the joystick full left and hitting both C and Z.\r\n\r\n#### Model Selection\r\n\r\nYou can choose pre-programmed models by holding the joystick full up or down and hitting both C and Z. This will page through all available models.\r\n\r\n#### Model Creation\r\n\r\nModels are created in the code. ModelRegistry.h has all the models. The important bits of model creation are:\r\n\r\n* Model name\r\n* Number of inputs used\r\n* Number of channels used\r\n* Expo for each channel (Percentage, 0% is no expo)\r\n* Low and high rates for each channel\r\n* Mix matrix (see below)\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\nChannel mixing is achieved by setting up the mix matrix. If you configured n inputs and m channels to be used, the mix matrix is a nxm matrix that will be multiplied to the input vector to produce the channel outputs.\r\n\r\nSo if I is your input vector (by default (rudder, elevator, throttle, aileron)) and A a 2 x 4 matrix: A*I will be what's sent to the model.\r\n\r\n###### Example: \"elevon mixing\"\r\n\r\nLet's say you have a 2 channel model with elevon. You've configured 4 inputs and 2 channels. The matrix you want to use is this:\r\n\r\n    ((0 1 0  1)\r\n     (0 1 0 -1))\r\n\r\nThat will add up aileron and elevator for channel 1 and add up the inverse of the aileron and elevator for channel two.\r\n\r\n(The actual values for the matrix are given as \"PERCENT_TO_BYTE(x)\" where x is the percentage of the input value you want to take. This is done for code size reasons.)\r\n\r\n### Lots of 'borrowed' code:\r\n\r\n   * RCEncoder was lifted from the forums: http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1243998214 \r\n   * Adafruit_* code is form here: https://github.com/adafruit (both the graphics and the ssd1306)\r\n   * WiiChuck from the playground: http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/WiiChuckClass\r\n\r\nBuild via: https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
